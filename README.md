# GatorGrade Hello World

This repository contains a sample assignment that can be used to demonstrate [GatorGrade](https://github.com/GatorEducator/gatorgrade), a tool that runs GatorGrader checks. This sample assignment includes simple source code, a reflection document, and a `gatorgrade.yml` file that defines example GatorGrader checks. Please note that this sample assignment is a "starter" assignment, meaning that GatorGrader checks will initially fail. Once the assignment is correctly completed, all GatorGrader checks should pass.
